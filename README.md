# contao-backendhelper

Tiny extension for Contao CMS (^4.1) that should provide several useful backend helpers in the future.

For now it only adds a link to the install tool in the BE header bar to make it easier to update the Database (e.g. when installing a new extension).

## Features included
* quick link to install tool
