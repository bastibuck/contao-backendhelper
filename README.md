# contao-backendhelper

Tiny extension for Contao CMS (3.5 or ^4.1) that provides several useful backend helpers in the future.

For now it only adds a link to the install tool in the BE header bar to make it easier to update the Database (e.g. when installing a new extension).

## Features included
* quick link to install tool (can be enabled for each user)
